# Circular Economy and Waste Management

Mothership Coder Mission 2: [Living Environment Challenges](https://www.space4good.com/coder-missions/)

## Problem Definition
There is lack of information of the return on investment (ROI) and efficiency of circular economy practices and waste management. You can think of recycling activities, alternative waste collection methods, waste transport logistics, etc. See [circular economy indicators report](https://www.metabolic.nl/publications/circulaire-indicatoren-een-verkenning-voor-de-provincie-zuid-holland/) by Metabolic for  PZH.

## Example research questions
Can you detect the streets where people are NOT separating wastes into containers and what is their demographic (age, household type)? What new recycling activities, alternative waste collection methods, waste transport logistics can you think of to improve waste management in Zuid-Holland?

#### Others
What is the efficiency and financial gains or losses of implementing various policies taking into consideration factors like but not limiting to:
Recycling policies of different municipalities
Import and Export of waste
Industrial vs. Living areas
Houses vs. Apartment buildings
Infrastructure and logistics analysis of various waste collection activities
Urban planning of different cities
What factory is producing what type of waste?

## Deliverables
The participating team is asked to conduct the necessary research and build a prototype of a system able to:
Investigate the suggested research questions and any additional relevant ones
Find patterns in the historical and real-time data
Simulate different future scenarios (trade-off analysis) 
Calculate the financial projections of the various simulated scenarios for the local government
Deliver a report on the findings and opportunity maps based on the results.

## Stakeholders

- Local and national government
- Waste management companies
- Business and industrial organizations
- Recycling plants
